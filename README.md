# ITMO BComp trace table generator
A simple script for generating trace table when doing lab work with the bcomp emulator written by my teacher. Now there is a newer version of bcomp, so I think I could publish my script, because it was cool :sunglasses:.

## Usage
Download the script as well as the `bcomp.jar` file. By default you should place them in the same folder, but this path to `bcomp.jar` can also be changed. Of course you need `python` and `java` installed.

For printing helps:
```
python3 tracetable-generator.py --help
```

## Limitations
- Can only works with VU1. It can be modified thought to work with other VU and also even input, but I was too lazy to do that.
- Cannot work with microcommand. But the same concept can be applied if you want to write your own version.
